This project demonstrates end-to-end automation testing of the Swag Labs(https://www.saucedemo.com/) e-commerce web application using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. It was completed as part of an internship/job portfolio to showcase practical QA and test automation skills.


## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **Java**
- **Maven**
- **TestNG 

## ðŸ“‚ Project Contents
- `project proposal`                     â€“ get approval from the supervisor
- `test_plan`                            â€“ Structured test planning document
- `feature wise userStories`             â€“ identify requiremets & design testScanarios
- `requirement tracerbilty matrix`       â€“ mapping requiremnts with test scanarios and test cases
- `test cases`                           - Step-by-step instructions to validate application functionality against expected results.
- `test execution report`               - A summary showing the pass/fail status of executed test cases.
- `QA summary report`                   - A high-level overview of the testing process, results, and release recommendation.
- `Automation summary report`           - A report summarizing automated test execution results and key observations.
- `Automation Test Script`              - Code written to automate testing of application using Selenium
